                Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites
                and applications is truly a passion of mine. This industry
                appeals to me because it's some of the most rewarding and
                challenging work I've ever done! I love bringing concepts to
                life through code. I am seeking projects as a web developer to
                maximize the value I can bring to end-users in todayâ€™s digital
                world. I look forward to being continuously challenged and
                learning new things every day.

                Apart from coding all day and night, I enjoy reading, watching
                Hockey, movies, and I also enjoy plants. I am currently running
                out of window ledges!
